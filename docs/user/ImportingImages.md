# Importing Images

In the **Cartographer App**, there are three ways to import images:

1. **From a local MEI file** — the file references images hosted on a IIIF server.  
2. **Directly from a IIIF server** — by providing the IIIF manifest link.  
3. **From a local folder** — by importing image files stored on your computer.

   - **Get Test URI** → use the sample manifest provided with Cartographer.  
   - **Paste Your URI** → enter your own IIIF manifest URI in the input field.  
      ![Import IIIF Manifest](images/IIIF_Import.png)  
3. Click **Import** to load the images.  
4. (Optional) Click **Cancel** to close the dialog without importing.  

## Importing from a Local Folder

Clicking the **menu icon** in the header opens a list of options.  
Select **“Import Local Image”** to import images directly from a folder on your computer.

Supported image formats include **JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, and TIFF**.
TIFF files whose pixel data is stored as an embedded JPEG are supported as well;
the app reconstructs a complete, browser-readable JPEG automatically.

### Step-by-Step

1. Click the **menu button** in the header.  
2. Click **Choose Folder** and select a folder that contains your images.  
3. Review the list of detected images shown in the dialog.

5. (Optional) Click **Cancel** to close the dialog without importing.  

While the images are being processed a loading spinner is shown. If you import
images together with an MEI file whose image references do not match the files
you provided, an **Image Mismatch Warning** is displayed so you can resolve the
difference before continuing.
