## Importing Images

In the **Cartographer App**, there are four ways to import images:

1. From a local MEI file — the file references images hosted on a IIIF server.
2. Directly from a IIIF server — by providing the IIIF manifest link.
3. From a local folder — by importing image files stored on your computer.
4. From a GitHub repository — by loading MEI files and images from your repositories (requires logging in with GitHub).

### Importing from a Local MEI File

Click the **menu icon** in the header to open the options.
Select **"Upload MEI File"** to import an MEI XML file.

- You can load the provided **test dataset** by clicking **"Load Test Data"**.
- Or click **"Choose File"** to open a file selection dialog and upload your own MEI file.
- After selecting a file, click **"Load"** to complete the import.
- To cancel, click **"Cancel"**.

If the MEI file references **local images** (rather than images hosted on a IIIF
server), another window will pop up after loading, asking you to choose the
referenced images from your computer.

#### Step-by-Step

1. Click the **menu button** in the header.
2. Choose one of the following:
   - **"Load Test Data"** → imports the sample dataset provided with Cartographer.
   - **"Choose File"** → opens a dialog to select a file from your computer.
3. Click **"Load"** to import the file.
4. If the MEI file references local images, a second dialog opens — select the corresponding image files (or folder) from your computer to complete the import.
5. (Optional) Click **"Cancel"** to exit without importing.

### Importing Directly from a IIIF Server

Click the **menu icon** in the header to open the options.
Select **"Import IIIF Manifest"** to import images directly from a IIIF server.

When you select **"Import IIIF Manifest"**, a dialog appears:

- **"Get Test URI"** → load the provided test manifest URI.
- **"Paste Your URI"** → manually paste your own IIIF manifest URI in the input box.
- **"Import"** → confirm and load the images.
- **"Cancel"** → close the dialog without importing.

#### Step-by-Step

1. Click the **menu button** in the header.
2. Choose one of the following:
   - **"Get Test URI"** → use the sample manifest provided with Cartographer.
   - **"Paste Your URI"** → enter your own IIIF manifest URI in the input field.
3. Click **"Import"** to load the images.
4. (Optional) Click **"Cancel"** to close the dialog.

### Importing from a Local Folder

Click the **menu icon** in the header to open the options.
Select **"Import Local Image"** to import images from a folder on your computer.

- Click **"Choose Folder"** to select a folder containing your images.
- The dialog lists every detected image so you can review them before importing.
- Click **"Import"** to add the images as pages.
- To cancel, click **"Cancel"**.

Supported formats include JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP, and TIFF (including
TIFF files that store their pixel data as an embedded JPEG). If the images do not
match the references of a loaded MEI file, an **Image Mismatch Warning** is shown
so the difference can be resolved before continuing.

### Importing from a GitHub Repository

To load files from GitHub, you first need to log in:

1. Click the **menu button** in the header and select **"Login with GitHub"**.
2. You are redirected to GitHub to authorize the app, then returned to Cartographer. Your GitHub avatar appears in the header.

Once logged in, select **"Load from GitHub"** in the header menu:

1. Select the repository you want to load from (private repositories are supported).
2. Choose the **branch** to load from.
3. To import an MEI file: go to the **Import MEI** tab, select the file, and click **"Load MEI"**.
4. To import images: go to the **Import Images** tab, navigate to a folder containing images, and click **"Import Images"**.

## Committing Changes to GitHub

If you loaded your MEI file from GitHub, you can save your changes back to the repository without leaving the app:

1. Click your **GitHub avatar** in the header and select **"Commit to GitHub"**.
2. The dialog shows the current commit destination (repository, branch, and file path). By default, the file is committed back to where it was loaded from.
3. Optionally, you can change the destination:
   - **Commit to a different repository** — select another of your repositories.
   - **Commit to a different branch** — choose an existing branch or create a new one.
   - **Change file path / name** — edit the path where the file will be saved.
4. Enter a **commit message** and confirm.

If the file was modified on GitHub after you loaded it, a **conflict warning** is
shown instead of silently overwriting the changes; you can then commit to a
different branch or path to resolve it.
