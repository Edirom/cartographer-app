# AppFooter Component

Displays the application footer, including the current mdiv label, zone count, loading status, and quick links to the About dialog and documentation.

---

## Overview

The `AppFooter` component provides:
- Display of the current mdiv (musical division) label (clickable, opens modal)
- Display of the number of zones on the current page
- Loading progress indicator
- An **About** link (opens the About modal) and a **Docs** link (opens the documentation)

> **Note:** Page navigation (previous/next and jump-to-page) is no longer part of the footer. It now lives in the sidebar, where the current page is an editable input that jumps to the entered page on **Enter** (there is no longer a "Go" button). See the **AppSidebar** documentation.

## Layout

- **Left**: Current mdiv label (clickable, opens modal)
- **Center**: Number of zones on the current page
- **Progress**: Shows loading progress bar if loading
- **Right**: About and Docs links
